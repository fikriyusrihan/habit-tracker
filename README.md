# Habit Tracker
Habit Tracker App is an application with functionality to record our new habits. With this application, you can store habits, get insight from your habits, and get daily notifications as your daily reminder. 

This application is my personal project for submission to the #JuaraAndroid event held by GDG Jakarta. If you are interested to learn how to develop a modern Android application, you can join this event by visiting this link http://goo.gle/juaraandroid and registering yourself before April 17th, 2022.
